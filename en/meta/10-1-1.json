The choice of the bottom 40% as the target population is one of practical compromise. The bottom 40% differs across countries depending on the welfare distribution, and it can change over time within a country. Because boosting shared prosperity is a country-specific goal, there is no numerical target defined globally.","computation_calculations":"1\uc778\ub2f9 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc18c\ub4dd(\uc18c\ube44)\uc758 \uc5f0\uac04 \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\ub85c, \ub450 \uc2dc\uc810\uc758 \uc18c\ub4dd(\uc18c\ube44) \ubd84\ud3ec \ud558\uc704 40% \uc778\uad6c\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc18c\ub4dd(\uc18c\ube44) \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\ub2f9 \uae30\uac04 \uc5f0\ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud568. \uc804\uccb4 \uc778\uad6c\uc758 1\uc778\ub2f9 \uc18c\ub4dd(\uc18c\ube44) \uc131\uc7a5\ub960 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc778\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud568","global_indicator_name":"Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40 per cent of the population and the total population","un_designated_tier":"II","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank (WB)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-10-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-10-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_local_link":"https://kostat-sdg-kor.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/data/Metadata-10-01-01_ENG.pdf","goal_meta_local_link_text":"https://kostat-sdg-kor.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/data/Metadata-10-01-01_ENG.pdf","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","computation_units":"\ud37c\uc13c\ud2b8(%)","graph_title":"Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita (%)","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"inequality","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank (WB)","source_active_2":true,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"10-01-01","source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_url_3":"Link to source","source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_url_text_6":"Link to source","source_active_7":false,"source_url_text_7":"Link to source","source_active_8":false,"source_url_text_8":"Link to source","source_active_9":false,"source_url_text_9":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","page_content":""}
