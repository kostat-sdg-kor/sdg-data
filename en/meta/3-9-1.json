For a population-weighted modelled annual average anthropogenic background PM2.5\u00a0concentration x, RR is calculated as (1.06)(x/10)\u00a0(COMEAP, 2010). The fraction of deaths attributable to\u00a0PM2.5\u00a0is expressed as a percentage, calculated as 100*(RR-1)/RR. Population-weighted annual average concentrations of anthropogenic PM2.5 were provided by AEA for all lower tier and unitary LAs within England. These were combined to produce figures at upper tier, regional and national level so that attributable fractions can be calculated at those scales also. The 2011 data for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly have been combined."}
