  Prior to 2011 PNP data were estimated. From 2011 data has been collected from
  a biennial survey with non-survey years being estimated using data from survey
  years. New higher education financial reporting standards starting on or after
  1 January 2015 have resulted in significant changes in how financial
  performance is reported. This presents difficulties in comparing results from
  2015 onwards with historical trends.
