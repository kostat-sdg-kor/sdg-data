  The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) is responsible for estimation using the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) data. In Korea, proficiency levels of those who completed grades 2 or 3 are measured using the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), an international assessment of grade 4 students in mathematics and science; proficiency levels at the end of lower secondary education are measured through the PISA.
