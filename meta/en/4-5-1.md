national_indicator_description: >-
  This indicator is defined as the ratio of the value of the underlying indicator (e.g. 4.1.1) 
  for one sub-group to that of another. Typically, the value for the likely more disadvantaged 
  group is the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups although, 
  for analytical purposes, values between 0.97 and 1.03 are typically assumed to be at parity.
