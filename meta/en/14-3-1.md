  Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative
  sampling stations
  
indicator_definition: >-
  The average marine acidity is expressed as pH, the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale. At least two of the four parameters, i.e. pH, pCO2, DIC (CT), and TA (AT) are measured and converted to pH values. An agreed suite of representative sampling stations are sites that have a measurement frequency that is adequate for describing variability and trends in carbonate chemistry in order to deliver critical information on the exposure of and impacts on marine systems to ocean acidification, and which provide data of sufficient quality and with comprehensive metadata information to enable integration with data from other sites in the country. For this indicator, data are that explain the variability of marine acidity collected from each sampling station and their annual mean values are used.
