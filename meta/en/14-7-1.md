  Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing
  States, least developed countries and all countries

indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator expresses the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (the sum of the value added (VA) from all sectors in an economy). Although target 14.7 encompasses fisheries, aquaculture and tourism, this indicator focuses only on the sustainable use of marine resources by fisheries. The methodology hereby proposed by FAO thus measures sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP, in accordance to the agreed indicator formulation.
