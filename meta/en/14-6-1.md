  By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to
  overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal,
  unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such
  subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential
  treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral
  part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.

  Depending on the adherence and implementation of the instruments, states score
  an indicator value between 0 and 1 with a weighting given to each indicator. The
  scores represent the state’s implementation level at the time of reporting, but they
  are converted to a five-point scale value to help with the understanding of the
  indicator.
