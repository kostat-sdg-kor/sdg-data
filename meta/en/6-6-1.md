  <b> Estimated data by international organizations (Type2) </b>   <br>
  This is Korean data prepared by international organizations through estimation and modeling. <br>
  If there are no national data corresponding to UN SDGs indicators, international data are available for monitoring.

indicator_name: Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time

global_indicator_name: Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time

indicator_definition: >-
  The indicator includes five categories: vegetated wetlands, rivers and estuaries, lakes, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies.

  Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets:   <br>
  ➀ Sub-Indicator 1 – spatial extent of water-related ecosystems    <br>
  ➁ Sub-Indicator 2 – water quality of lakes and artificial water bodies   <br>   <br>
  Level 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:   <br>
  ➂ Sub-Indicator 3 – quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries   <br>
  ➃ Sub-Indicator 4 – water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2   <br>
  ➄ Sub-Indicator 5 – quantity of groundwater within aquifers   <br>
