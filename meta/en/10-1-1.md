  Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40
  per cent of the population and the total population

indicator_definition: >-
  The annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the bottom 40% of the income distribution in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period. The choice of the bottom 40% as the target population is one of practical compromise. The bottom 40% differs across countries depending on the welfare distribution, and it can change over time within a country. Because boosting shared prosperity is a country-specific goal, there is no numerical target defined globally.
