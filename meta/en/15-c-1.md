  Please note that the total number of seizures may not equate to the sum of the
  CITES seizures, this is due to the possibility of multiple seizures. A
  multiple seizure is where two or more category types (e.g. caviar and timber)
  are seized on a particular occasion. The occasion is counted once in the total
  number of seizures, but a seizure is counted against each category.
