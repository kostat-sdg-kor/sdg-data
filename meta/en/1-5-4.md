indicator_definition: >-
  The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: "Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020". 
  In line therewith, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. 
  Member states count the number of local governments that adopt and implement local DRR strategies in line with the national strategy and express it as a percentage of the total number of local governments in the country.
