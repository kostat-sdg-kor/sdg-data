indicator_name: Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk of extinction

global_indicator_name: Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk of extinction

indicator_definition: >-
  The percentage of local livestock breeds among local breeds with known risk status classified as being at risk of extinctions. Local breeds are divided into ones with known risk status and ones with unknown risk status, and breeds with known risk status are either classified as being at risk of extinctions or not.
  The risk class is considered to be "unknown" if no population sizes are reported or the most recent population size reported refers to a year more than 10- years before the year of calculation. The risk status is categorized Critical, Endangered, and Vulnerable. For detailed categorization criteria, see the UN metadata methodology.
