Housing costs such as rent, Council Tax, mortgage payments etc. are excluded from the measure, meaning expenditure is counted on an \u2018after housing costs\u2019 (AHC)  basis. Household Income - The measure we use for income is household disposable income, AHC. Disposable income is the amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after direct taxes (such as Income Tax, National Insurance and Council Tax) and pension contributions have been accounted for. It includes earnings from employment, private pensions and investments as well as cash benefits provided by the state. Reflecting household size - The expenditure and income measures used in this analysis are all equivalised. Equivalisation is the process of accounting for the fact that households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members. Both income and expenditure are adjusted using OECD-modified \u201ccompanion\u201d scales developed for AHC measures in thee Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Households below average income (HBAI) series.","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"10-01-01","source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_url_3":"Link to source","source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_url_text_6":"Link to source","source_active_7":false,"source_url_text_7":"Link to source","source_active_8":false,"source_url_text_8":"Link to source","source_active_9":false,"source_url_text_9":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","page_content":"\u25b6 Data unavailable: There are currently no national statistics (Type 1), international statistics (Type 2), or alternative national statistics (Type 3) available.
